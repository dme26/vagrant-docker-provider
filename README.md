This repo will build a docker image that can be used as a provider for [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) as a Linux development environment.

The ready made Docker Hub image can be found here: [rofrano/vagrant-provider:ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dme26/vagrant-provider) and is thanks to the project [from which this repository](https://github.com/rofrano/vagrant-docker-provider) is forked.


## Why Vagrant with Docker?

 This was inspired by Apple's introduction of the M1 chip which is ARM based. That means that solutions which use Vagrant and VirtualBox will not work on Apple M1 because VirtualBox requires an Intel processors. This lead me to find a solution for a virtual development environment that works with ARM and thus Apple M1 computers. You can find out more information about why I built it here:

[Developing on Apple M1 Silicon with Virtual Environments](https://johnrofrano.medium.com/developing-on-apple-m1-silicon-with-virtual-environments-4f5f0765fd2f)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) has introduced [Docker Desktop for Apple silicon](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-silicon/) that runs Docker on Macs that have the Apple M1 chip. By using Docker as a provisioner for Vagrant, we can simulate the same experience as developers using Vagrant with VirtualBox. This is one case where you actually do want a Docker container to behave like a VM.

## Image Contents

The `ubuntu` image is based on Ubuntu 21.04 and the `debian` image is Debian 11. Both contain the packages that are needed for a valid vagrant box. This includes the `vagrant` userid with password-less `sudo` privileges. It also contains as `sshd` server. Normally, it is considered a bad idea to run an `ssh` daemon in a Docker container but in this case, the Docker container is emulating a Virtual Machine (VM) to provide a development environment so it makes perfect sense. ;-)

## Example Vagrantfile

Here is a sample `Vagrantfile` that uses this image:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.hostname = "ubuntu"

  config.vm.provider :docker do |docker, override|
    override.vm.box = nil
    docker.image = "rofrano/vagrant-provider:ubuntu"
    docker.remains_running = true
    docker.has_ssh = true
    docker.privileged = true
    docker.volumes = ["/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw"]
    docker.create_args = ["--cgroupns=host"]
    # Uncomment to force arm64 for testing images on Intel
    # docker.create_args = ["--platform=linux/arm64"]     
  end  
end
```

### Example: Docker in Docker

This image will also run docker in docker. To install docker using vagrant add this to the `Vagrantfile`:

```ruby
  # Install Docker and pull an image
  config.vm.provision :docker do |d|
    d.pull_images "alpine:latest"
  end
```

This will install Docker and pull the `alpine:latest` image. You can pull and run any image you'd like.

### Example: ARM64

If you want to test the ARM version on an Intel computer just uncomment the `docker.create_args` line which adds `--platform=linux/arm64` to the arguments. This will add the `--platform` flag to the `docker run` command to force the `aarch64` image to be used via `qemu`.

There is also a `debian` variant to this image that is based on `debian:11`. That can be used by changing the `docker.image` line above to use the `rofrano/vagrant-provider:debian` image instead like this:

```ruby
    docker.image = "rofrano/vagrant-provider:debian"
```

## Command Line Usage

To use this provider, add the `--provider` flag to your `vagrant` command:

```sh
vagrant up --provider=docker
```

This will use this the docker image specified in your `Vagrantfile` as the base box.

You can also run this using the provided `Makefile` with:

```sh
make run
```

## Build Multi-Archtecture Image

To build this image you must use `buildx` and build it for multiple architectures so that it can run on both Intel and ARM machines.

### Initialize builder

If you don't have a builder you must first create one:

```sh
% export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
% docker buildx create --use --name=qemu
qemu
% docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

The provided `Makefile` will do this for you with:

```sh
make init
```

This will initialize the `buildx` provider as above.

### Building the default Ubuntu image

Then you can build the multi-platform image like this (where `{account}` is the name of your Docker Hub account):

```sh
docker buildx build --file Dockerfile.ubuntu --tag {account}/vagrant-provider:ubuntu --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push .
```

This will use QEMU to build a multi-platform image and push it to docker hub.

You can also build your image with `make`:

```sh
make build REGISTRY={your account}
```

It is better if you set an environment varaible called `REGISTRY` and it will be picked up by `make`. For example, if your Docker Hub account name is `foo` you would use:

```sh
export REGISTRY=foo
make build
```

This will ensure that all of the `make` commands will use your registry and not mine (i.e., `rofrano`)

### Building image variants

The default image is `ubuntu` but you can build the `debian` image by adding the argument `IMAGE_TAG=debian` like this:

```sh
make build IMAGE_TAG=debian
```

This will use the `Dockerfile.debian` and push to an image called `rofrano/vagrant-provider:debian`

If you want to add your own variant, just create a `Dockerfile` with the variant name as the extension and it will be picked up (e.g., `Dockerfile.alpine`). Then you can use `make build IMAGE_TAG=alpine` to build and push that image.

### Remove the buildx instance

When not needed, you can safely stop and/or remove the `buildx` containers with the following commands:

```sh
docker buildx stop
docker buildx rm
```

This can also be accomplised with:

```sh
make remove
```

## Credits

A huge thanks to [Matthew Warman](http://warman.io) who provided the `Dockerfile` from [mcwarman/vagrant-provider](https://github.com/mcwarman/vagrant-docker-provider) as the bases for my `Dockerfile` using `systemd`. He added all the magic to make it work and I am very greateful for his generosity.
